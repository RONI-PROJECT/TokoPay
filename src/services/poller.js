 * upgrade on a poller that remembered in RAM: a payment that lands while nothing
 * is running is still unseen on the next pass, so it gets reconciled instead of
 * being silently swallowed at the next cold start.
 *
 * Pages until it reaches an already-archived payment. With no traffic nothing
 * polls, and walk-in payments to the same merchant keep arriving meanwhile, so
 * one page can end before the payment an order is waiting on.
 *
 * No seeding pass is needed on a fresh deployment. `reconcile` never matches a
 * payment to an order created after it, so the pre-deployment history the first
 * pass reads is only archived.

/**
 * Run one maintenance cycle, but only if nobody has run one recently.

 * app traffic drives it. A payer watching the QR screen polls their own status
 * every few seconds, and each read may claim the slot and do a full cycle — poll
 * GoBiz, expire what is overdue, retry owed webhooks.
 *
 * Which means detection is near-real-time exactly while somebody is waiting, and
 * there are zero upstream calls when nobody is. That is also gentler on the GoBiz
 * account than a blind fixed-interval poller.
 *
 * The throttle lives in the database, so it holds across every instance at once.
 *
 * The tradeoff, stated plainly: with literally zero traffic nothing runs, so a
 * `payment.expired` webhook can sit until the next request touches the gateway.
 * `payment.paid` is unaffected — the cycle that finds the payment is the one that
 * settles it and queues the webhook.
